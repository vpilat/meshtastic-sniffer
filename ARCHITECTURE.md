# meshtastic-sniffer architecture

Single-binary wideband Meshtastic LoRa receiver. One SDR -> one wide IQ stream -> polyphase channelizer -> N parallel LoRa decoders -> AES-CTR + protobuf decode -> stdout / UDP / MQTT / ZMQ (optional CurveZMQ) / CoT multicast / PCAP file or fifo / daily-rotated gzipped JSONL archive / web SSE.

## Polyphase channelizer

The channelizer in `pfb.c` is a textbook critically-sampled decimator-by-M PFB:

1. Design a prototype lowpass `h[0..L*M-1]` with cutoff `1/(2M)` (Hamming-windowed sinc, L = 12 typical, ~-43 dB sidelobes)
2. Decompose into M branches: `h_p[i][k] = h[k*M + i]`
3. Per cycle of M input samples: forward commutator distributes across branches, each branch FIRs against its polyphase row, then a single M-point FFT produces all M output bins at `Fs/M` rate

Per-input-sample cost is `O(L + log M)` ops, vs `O(M)` for the per-channel-cascade DDC alternative. At M=80, that's ~7 ops/sample vs 80 -- the source of the wideband throughput. AVX2 SIMD on the FIR + OpenMP parallel-for over PFB groups (one per `(bw_hz, os_factor)` combination) lets the binary process 30+ Msps real-time on a single i7 core.

Channels are bound to PFB output bins via `pfb_register_bin` -- multiple decoders may bind to the same bin (a bin's callback list is a tiny linked list). The pre-shift NCO multiplies input by `exp(-j*2*pi*pre_shift_hz/Fs * n)` so the FFT's bin-0 lines up exactly with the configured channel grid.

## PFB bin-leakage dedup

Each LoRa transmission lights up roughly 30 leakage replicas across adjacent PFB output bins. Per-replica bit errors are independent across bins; the cleanest decode is whichever bin had the highest SNR. Picking the first replica that arrives is random; picking the highest-SNR replica is deterministically the best-quality copy.

Implementation in `main.c`:

1. New replica arrives -> compute payload fingerprint (64-bit XOR-fold of payload bytes; bit-error replicas produce near-identical fingerprints, real transmissions produce uncorrelated ones)
2. Find an existing cluster within Hamming distance 14 (real transmissions typically differ by ~32 bits; bit-error replicas by 1-5)
3. If found and this replica has higher SNR: replace cluster's stored best
4. If not found: open a new cluster, schedule emit at `now + 30 ms`
5. Drainer thread polls every 5 ms; when a cluster's emit time passes, hand its best-stored replica to `mesh_packet_decode_with_radio` -- single attempt, with the cleanest SNR copy = best decrypt odds

Density-safe: 100 simultaneous distinct transmissions create 100 distinct clusters (random fingerprints don't collide within 14 Hamming bits). The 30 ms window swallows leakage cluster from a single chirp without merging adjacent unrelated transmissions.

Result: one JSON line per real transmission, regardless of how many leakage replicas the channelizer emitted.

The drainer thread stamps a wall-clock heartbeat (`g_drainer_last_tick_us`) every 5 ms tick. The stats heartbeat checks this each cycle; if the drainer has gone silent for more than 5x the dedup window (150 ms), `[stats] WARN dedup drainer silent for ...` lands on stderr -- so a wedged drainer surfaces within seconds rather than silently swallowing every frame. A `g_dedup_stragglers` atomic counts emits that came in more than 2x the window late (CPU-saturation diagnostic) and ships out in the SSE STATS event so the dashboard can show it.

## Threading

```
main thread:
  -- options_parse()
  -- simd_init()
  -- build_channel_set() / keyset / channelizer / scanner / feed / web init
  -- create dedup_drainer_thread (5 ms tick, batches expirations under one lock)
  -- create stats_thread (1 s tick + 5 s heartbeat to stderr + STATS SSE)
  -- create input_thread (one of: hackrf_stream_thread, ..., file_src_thread, vita49_thread)
  -- poll loop: while (running) usleep(100000)
  -- pthread_join + cleanup

input_thread:
  drains the SDR (or file / VITA-49 socket) into sample_buf_t,
  calls push_samples() in this thread.

push_samples() (called from input_thread, not its own thread):
  -- channelizer_process_int8/float
       -> pfb_process per group (parallel-for if multiple groups)
            -> per-bin sink callbacks -> on_channel_baseband
                 -> lora_decoder_feed -> state machine -> on_lora_frame
                      -> dedup ring insert (under g_dedup_mu)
  -- scanner_feed_int8/float -> wideband FFT -> peakfind -> on_off_grid_discovery

dedup_drainer_thread:
  every 5 ms wakes up, batches up to 64 expired clusters under one
  lock acquire, then for each: mesh_packet_decode_with_radio ->
  on_mesh_event -> feed_publish_event -> stdout / UDP / MQTT / ZMQ /
  CoT / web SSE.

web thread:
  accept() loop, single-threaded request handling.
  Serves GET / (dashboard HTML), GET /events (SSE upgrade),
  POST /api/keys, POST /api/share-url, POST /api/extra-freq, POST /api/cot-multicast.
  SSE clients are kept in a small list (max 8) and broadcast to from
  feed_publish_event() via web_publish_line().

stats thread:
  every 1 s wakes up; every 5 s prints stderr heartbeat and pushes a
  STATS SSE event so the dashboard's persistent header has live counts.
```

All cross-thread state uses one of:

- `volatile sig_atomic_t running` (set by signal handler, polled by every thread)
- `__atomic_*` for hot counters (g_samples_total, g_frames_total, ...) and `channelizer.n_channels` (release/acquire ordering for race-free runtime channel addition)
- `pthread_rwlock_t` on `keyset_t` (write-lock around add, read-lock during decode lookup-and-decrypt)
- `pthread_mutex_t` on web SSE client list, cot endpoint state, node_db, dedup ring

## Multi-key dispatch (no per-packet brute-force)

Meshtastic frames carry a 1-byte `channel` field in the radio header equal to `xorHash(channel_name) ^ xorHash(psk)`. At `keyset_add` time the same hash is precomputed for each loaded `(name, psk)` pair and bucketed into `buckets[256]`. Per packet `header.channel` reads, looks up the bucket, and tries the (typically 1, occasionally 2) candidate keys. A successful protobuf parse is the confirmation. **Adding more keys does not slow per-packet decode** -- steady-state cost is one AES-CTR op + one protobuf parse, regardless of how many keys are loaded.

Bucket capacity is 7 collisions per single-byte hash. With well-distributed keys ~50 entries fit before the first bucket fills.

## Runtime mutability

The web Config tab can add keys, paste channel-share URLs, add extra-frequency decoder slots, and change the CoT multicast destination -- all without restarting the binary.

- `keyset_t` has a `pthread_rwlock_t` -- `keyset_add` takes the write lock briefly, `keyset_lookup` callers hold the read lock for the duration of lookup-and-decrypt. New keys take effect on the very next packet.
- `channelizer_t::n_channels` is `__atomic_store_n`-released after the new channel pointer is fully initialised; the hot loop does `__atomic_load_n`-acquire. Newly-added channels start receiving samples on the next channelizer_process_* call.
- `cot.c` keeps the multicast destination behind a mutex; `cot_set_endpoint(host, port)` reopens the socket atomically. Empty body to `POST /api/cot-multicast` disables CoT entirely.
- `scanner_t` known-grid array is replaced wholesale on each `scanner_set_known_grid` call; new extra-freq slots immediately start being excluded from the off-grid alert path.

## Validation

What's verified:

- **Channelizer routing** (smoke-tested in `tests/test_smoke.sh`): synthetic tone at 902.625 MHz lights up channel 2 at -2.13 dB inside a 20 MHz capture
- **AES + multi-key + protobuf round-trip**: synthesized `TEXT_MESSAGE_APP` packet decodes back to "Hello"
- **LoRa bit-level stages**: hard-decode Hamming, deinterleave, gray, dewhiten verified bit-exact against gr-lora_sdr stage outputs (fixtures at `tests/fixtures/lora_stages/`)
- **End-to-end LoRa decode**: real-radio HackRF capture on US LongFast / ShortFast / ShortTurbo decrypts back to plaintext text+position+nodeinfo
- **SigMF auto-config**: rate / freq / datatype picked up from `.sigmf-meta` sibling
- **All 4 web `/api/*` endpoints**: round-trip via curl
- **STATS SSE event**: arrives at the dashboard within one heartbeat
- **AddressSanitizer + UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer**: zero findings on the smoke-test suite (selftest, file replay, web API hits, key adds)
- **ThreadSanitizer**: zero data races under concurrent `/api/keys` POSTs hitting while the demod thread is in `keyset_lookup`
- **Polyphase channelizer throughput**: 30+ Msps sustained on a single i7 core, with the full US `--presets=all` grid (409 channels at 20 MHz HackRF: 41 LongFast + 41 each of ShortFast/Slow/MediumFast/Slow + 81 each of LongModerate/LongSlow + 21 each of ShortTurbo/LongTurbo)

Known runtime concerns deliberately not blocked-on:

- SDRplay's proprietary `libsdrplay_api.so.3` has a double-free in its `sdrplay_api_Close()` exit handler (third-party; surfaces only at process exit when `--list` enumerated SoapySDR drivers). Not actionable from our side.

## Self-test entry points

`./meshtastic-sniffer --selftest` runs two synthesized smoke checks (channelizer + AES end-to-end). `bash tests/test_smoke.sh` adds SigMF auto-config, `--list`, web `/api/*` round-trip, STATS SSE heartbeat, and stats heartbeat. Both run clean under sanitizers (`-fsanitize=address,undefined`).

`MESHTASTIC_LORA_TRACE=1` enables a per-symbol state-machine trace on stderr, useful for debugging decode against a known-good reference.
