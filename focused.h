 * one DDC chain (NCO mixer + Hamming LPF + decimator) and one
 * lora_decoder_t. The worker runs on its own thread, polls the ring
 * at a fixed batch size, and emits frames through the supplied
 * lora_frame_cb_t so the same dedup / feed / JSON pipeline carries

 * time (manual focus) or deferred until the first arm_slot() call
 * (pool-managed workers).
