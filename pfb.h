/*
 * meshtastic-sniffer: polyphase filterbank channelizer.
 *
 * Decimator-by-M PFB with critical sampling: input at Fs, M output
 * channels at Fs/M each. Channels are uniformly spaced by Fs/M starting
 * from the (pre-shifted) input's DC. Adjacent channels are isolated by
 * the prototype filter -- with a Hamming-windowed sinc of length L*M
 * the worst-case sidelobe is around -42 dB, which keeps a strong LoRa
 * chirp from leaking into the neighbour bin.
 *
 * Classical critically-sampled PFB: per cycle of M input samples we
 * commute each into its branch's delay line, FIR each branch with its
 * polyphase row of the prototype, then FFT the M branch outputs to
 * produce one sample per output channel. Cost amortizes to (L + log M)
 * ops per input sample -- vs O(M) for the per-channel cascade DDC, an
 * O(M / log M) speedup.
